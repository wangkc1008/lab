He also\\nhas severe peripheral arterial disease s/p peripheral bypass\\nsurgery. He presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital ER this morning with\\nshortness of breath and chest pain and was found to be in heart\\nfailure.\\n\\nHe states he was in his usual state of health until 10:30 last\\nevening when he woke up feeling cold; 1 hour later he developed\\nmoderate to severe sharp chest pain radiating across his chest\\nassociated with nausea, diaphoresis, and dypsnea. The pain was\\nfairly constant and did not resolve until he was given sL NTG at\\n6 am by EMS. He has been pain free since. Presenting vitals BP\\n109/66, HR 71, O2 sat 88% on RA. CXR showed congestive heart\\nfailure; initial troponin-I was mildly elevated at 0.4, CK 70.\\nHe given aspirin and furosemide 80 mg IV (with ~600cc diuresis),\\nNitropaste [**1-3**]\", and Lovenox 80 mg SQ. During the ambulance\\ntransfer to the [**Hospital1 18**], he also received ~500 cc IVF for ? low\\nBP).\\n\\nOn further questioning, Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] has very poor exercise\\ntolerance due to knee pain that he attributes to osteoarthritis.\\nBut he says that he gets chest pain (similar to pain he had last\\nnight) with fairly minimal exertion (picking up his 11 lb cat,\\ncarrying 1 gallon jug of water, first getting up from sitting to\\nwalk outside or to walk to the bedroom). The pain is associated\\nwith dyspnea and is relieved with few minutes rest. His symptoms\\noccur about every day to every other day and have been stable\\nover the past year. He denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal\\ndyspnea, but does endorse exertional dyspnea (he cannot identify\\nthe amount of exertion required). Currently, he is dyspneic and\\nfeels somewhat better sitting up; he reports no chest pain.\\n\\nROS is also positive for a nose bleed requiring ED visit several\\nmonths ago (and cessation of Plavix for a few days), and\\ncurrently gross hematuria after Foley placement and Lovenox.\\n\\nPast Medical History:\\n1.

Intraventricular\\nconduction defect. Left ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave\\nchanges most likely related to left ventricular hypertrophy.\\nCompared to the previous tracing of [**2124-4-9**] ventricular premature\\nbeats are more frequent, as are atrial premature beats. Clinical\\ncorrelation is suggested.\\n\\nCXR [**2125-2-9**]: The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG.\\nThe heart size appears slightly enlarged compared to the\\nprevious study.  Bilateral perihilar haziness continues toward\\nthe lower lungs is new consistent with new moderate- to-severe\\npulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusion is present, also\\nnew, most likely part of the heart failure.   Left and right\\nretrocardiac opacities consistent with atelectasis.\\n\\nECHO [**2125-2-11**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild\\nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.\\nThere is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction\\nwith akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolaterl\\nwalls. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF\\n= 25-30 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.\\nTissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular\\nfilling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size\\nis normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The\\naortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe\\naortic valve stenosis (area 0.6 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation\\nis seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to\\nmoderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary\\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no\\npericardial effusion. Compared with the prior report (images\\nunavailable of [**2119-5-8**], left ventricular systolic function is now\\ndepressed and the severity of aortic stenosis has increased.\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nPatient is a 84 yo man with CAD s/p CABG twice with daily\\nangina, presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, and congestive\\nheart failure.\\n\\n# CAD: The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup\\nand treatment of chest pain. A chest X-ray performed on\\nadmission showed moderate-severe pulmonary edema. He did have a\\nstably elevated troponin thought to be related to acute heart\\nfailure or demand ischemia. He was started on a Lasix drop at 10\\nmg/hr for initiation of diuresis. He initially tolerated this\\nwell, however at approximately 8 pm on [**2125-2-10**], Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] was\\ntransferred from the floor to the CCU after complaining of chest\\npain when he was sitting in bed after dinner. As he was being\\nevaluated by the housestaff, he became unresponsive and\\ndeveloped pulseless electrical arrest. Chest compressions were\\nstarted, but within approximately 2 minutes, he became\\nresponsive and regained a palpable pulse. His rhythm appeared to\\nbe atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate initially in the\\n50s but rising to the 110\\'s. Review of his telemetry showed that\\nhe had developed atrial fibillation earlier in the evening\\nwithout obvious ventricular arrhythmias immediately prior to his\\narrest (which was attributed to a vasovagal episode in the\\nsetting of heart failure and aortic stenosis).  On transfer to\\nthe CCU, he was started on levophed for hypotension and\\namiodarone IV for AFib. Chest x-ray on [**2125-2-10**] showed interval\\nworsening of pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions and\\nbibasilar atelectasis.  At this time his cardiac enzymes became\\nvery elevated with EKG changes consistent of a NSTEMI with a CK\\nto 1006 and troponin to 3.82. On [**2125-2-11**], he had a transthoracic\\nechocardiogram which showed moderate regional left ventricular\\nsystolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal half of the\\ninferior and inferolateral walls. LVEF was 25-30 %, with severe\\naortic stenosis and [**1-3**]+ mitral regurgitation. He was\\naggressively diuresed with an IV Lasix drip with improvement in\\nhis oxygen requirement and chest x-ray.  Levophed was\\ndiscontinued on [**2-12**], and blood pressures remained stable off\\npressors with MAP\\'s 60 - 70.  On [**2125-2-13**], he was transferred\\nback to the floor team on PO amiodarone. He remained in normal\\nsinus rhythm on telemetry on po amiodarone, and diuresis was\\ncontinued with a Lasix drip with good urine output and\\nimprovement of renal function. He remained asymptomatic with no\\nshortness of breath or chest pain after transfer. He was\\nmaintained on a heparin drip bridging to Coumadin for paroxysmal\\natrial fibrillation. His metoprolol was held for hypotension in\\nthe ICU and relative hypotension with SBP in 90s and low 100s\\nupon transfer to the floor. ACE-inhibitor was held due to\\nrelative hypotension and renal insufficiency with Creat 1.7. A\\ncardiac surgery consult deemed him an acceptable candidate for a\\n3rd open heart surgery for aortic valve replacement pending\\nre-assessment of his coronary anatomy. The intermediate-term\\nplan was to allow recovery from the current episode and\\ndiscussion as an outpatient with his primary cardiologist\\nregarding the risks and benefits of aortic valve replacement.\\n\\nOn [**2-16**], the patient became hypotensive to SBPs to\\n60s-70s after getting into a chair after breakfast. He was given\\n1L NS with no response in BP. The patient was mentating but\\nbecame short of breath with IVF. He had worsening EKG changes.\\nHe was started on Levophed without improvement in his blood\\npressure. He was brought to the catherization laboratory for\\npotential emergent aortic valvuloplasty and was intubated. At\\nthat point, he suffered a PEA arrest and could not be\\nresuscitated. He was pronounced deceased at 12:33pm.\\n\\n# Pump: As above. The patient had severe pulmonary edema with\\ninitial exam revealing crackles throughout his lung fields. He\\nwas treated with a Lasix drip which was transitioned on [**2-16**] to\\npo Lasix 80 mg po twice daily.\\n\\n# Rhythm: Patient was in NSR on admission. On HD #2, he had\\nchest pain, then went into PEA arrest as described above.\\nTelemetry showed atrial fibrillation prior to the event. In the\\nCCU, he was started on amiodarone 400 mg po tid to be tapered\\nover the subsequent weeks.\\n\\n# Acute renal failure: Renal function initially declined\\n(creatinine to 2.1), then improved on Lasix gtt, but stayed 1.7\\n- 1.9 (above baseline of 1.3).\\n\\n# Hematuria: He had hematuria (no clots) after traumatic Foley\\nplacement at the outside hospital. The catheter was removed on\\n[**2-16**] with gradual resolution of hematuria.\\n\\n# Diabetes: Due to acute renal failre, metformin was\\ndiscontinued and the patient was maintained on a Humalog sliding\\nscale with 30 units of Lantus at bedtime.\\n\\n# Hematoma. The patient developed a small hematoma at the site\\nof his right internal jugular venous access after catheter\\nremoval.

He also had an episode of\\nAVNRT and was loaded on digoxin, however this was discontinued\\non discharge.\\n.\\nHe was transferred back to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**9-2**], where he was\\nreportedly doing well until the morning of transfer, when he was\\nnoted to be hypotensive to systolic of 60s.  He was taken to\\n[**Hospital1 882**] ED where initial vitals were T 96.4, BP 76/48, HR 80,\\n98% on RA.  An EKG reportedly revealed ST depressions with TWI\\nin V2-V3.  A CXR showed CHF.  Troponin T was 0.34 which is\\nactually decreased from 1.74 on discharge.  He was given an [**Hospital1 **]\\nand started on a heparin drip.  Labs were notable for mildly\\nelevated creatinine of 1.2, hct 28.9, mild leukocytosis at 11.\\nA UA was positive and he was given unasyn as well as gentamicin\\ndue to concern for urosepsis.  He was given 1.5 liters of IVF.\\nThe heparin drip was discontinued as ischemia was felt to be\\nless likely at that point.  However, on the morning of [**9-10**], the\\npatient was still hypotensive, with new ST elevations in V1-V3,\\nas well as a troponin elevation to 5.7.  He was restarted on a\\nheparin drip and arrangments were made for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for\\ncatheterization.\\n.\\nCatheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] on the day of transfer revealed\\nmarkedly elevated right and left sided filling pressures (PCWP\\n32, PA 60/28), as well as new 100% in stent stenosis of the LAD.\\n Unfortunately the lesion was difficult to cross and the\\nprocedure was aborted after 78 minutes of fluoro time and 230 cc\\nof contrast, with plans for possible re-catheterization the next\\nday.  The patient was given 40 mg IV lasix in the cath lab, and\\nanother 40 mg IV lasix on arrival to the CCU, with almost 2 L\\nurine output within 2 hours of CCU arrival.\\n.\\nThe patient himself seemed somewhat confused.

CAD: Patient pmh included CAD status post CABG in [**2106**] (LIMA\\nto LAD, SVG to D2 with jump graft to OM, and SVG to RCA), CHF\\n(EF 45%), with 2 recent stents to LAD and D1, and he was\\ntransferred from OSH with concern for new ST elevations and\\nincrease in cardiac enzymes. At [**Hospital1 18**], catheterization on [**9-10**]\\nshowed 100% in stent restenosis of the LAD stent, which could\\nnot be easily passed by balloon. Due to length of procedure and\\nconcern for overexposure to fluoroscopy and dye-load, procedure\\nwas stopped and repeated on [**9-11**] with different fluoro angle. On\\nthe repeat attempt, balloon was passed and stent was placed in\\nthe LAD.\\nPatient was continued on Plavix and [**Month/Day (4) **]. Statin had been\\ndiscontinued following last hospital stay (discharged [**9-4**]) due\\nto concern about increased LFTs. It was not restarted. If LFT's\\ntrend downward, he may be able to be re-started as an\\noutpatient.\\n.\\n2. Hypotension: Patient had low blood pressures during hospital\\nstay with systolic dipping below 80s during sleep. Patient did\\nnot demonstrate symptoms of altered mental status or\\nlightheadedness during these epidsodes. Oxygen saturation and\\nurine output remained adequate. Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors\\nwere held during stay due to low blood pressure. The patient's\\nBB and ACEI may be re-started if his BP continues to rise after\\ndischarge.\\n.\\n3. UTI: Urinalysis at outside hospital was positive and patient\\nwas placed on levoquin. Subsequent culture with sensitivity\\ndemonstrated resistance to levoquin and patient switched to\\npiperacillin-tazobactam. After confirming with the OSH\\nlaboratory, there was felt to be no concern for ESBL and he was\\ndischarged on Augmentin given sensitivity to Unasyn. He will be\\ntreated for a total of 7 days after being started on Zosyn so he\\nwill complete a 5 day course of Augmentin after discharge.\\n.\\n4. CHF: Echo this admission demonstrates an EF of 40% with\\napical akinesis and distal septal akinesis. Notably\\nechocardiograms from last two admissions this year included\\nechos with dyskinesis, but not apical akinesis. Patient was\\nstarted on coumadin and bridged with heparin to prevent clot\\nformation. He was discharged on Lovenox until INR therapeutic\\nand Coumadin will be continued for at least 6 months until\\nrepeat echo. His INR values will need to be followed upon\\ndischarge.\\n.\\n5. h/o supraventricular tachycardia:\\nFor rhythm control, patient was continued on his standard\\namiodarone dose. Amiodarone was briefly stopped during admission\\nand patient had some runs of asymptomatic SVT.\\n.\\n6. T2DM\\nThe patient's blood sugars were well controlled during this\\nhospitalization on an ISS. The ISS will be continued upon\\ndischarge.\\n.\\n7.
